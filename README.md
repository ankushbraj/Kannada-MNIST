# Kannada-MNIST
This is project for APPLIED ARTIFICIAL IINTELLIGENCE Module at SRH Heidelberg


## Overview
Kannada is my Mothertongue and is a language spoken predominantly by people of Karnataka in southwestern India. The language has roughly 45 million native speakers and is written using the Kannada script [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada).

The digital handwritten dataset, termed Kannada-MNIST was released on 3rd August 2019 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01242.pdf). The github repo of the author can be found [here.](https://github.com/vinayprabhu/Kannada_MNIST).

This project aims at classifying Kannada digits using Convolutional Neural Network. 

Google Cloud Platform is used for training of the Deep learning model and deployed using Jupyter Notebook. The Dataset is mounted with Google drive. Google's Deeplearning framework, Keras is used for model creation.
